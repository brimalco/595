I hope to expand more on what was taught in 593 and put the fundamentals in to practice. This is my first time creating a docker and a repository on my own. I'm able to follow the directions. However, I did not completely understand what happened and why. So, it would be interesting to learn more about the mechanisms of it and work on projects to reinforce the concepts. I also like to get more comfortable with programming and debugging in C.
